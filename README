Welcome to radar

radar is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details. 

1. Installation:
      1.1 retrieve the file radar.tgz from 

      ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/contrib/heger/radar/src/radar.tgz
      
      1.2 extract source files. Do this in a temporary build directory.

      tar -xvzf radar.tgz

      1.3 type 

      ./configure; make; make install

2. Usage:
      Before you find out yourself, the user interface to radar is pretty 
      basic and not very comfortable and fault-tolerant. The basic usage 
      is the following:

      radar -P c -Q c -R c [-S c] [-V n]

      where the parameters are
	-P filename of the multiple alignment
        -Q filename of lfasta-output
        -R filename of the sequence
        -S filename of sequence lfasta-file[optional]
        -V level of verbosity. 0 is lowest, 4 is highest.

      The multiple alignment file should contain the rows separated
      by newlines.
      
      The sequence file should just contain the sequence.
      
      The fasta-files contain the output of the lfasta program.

      See the directory ./example for templates for these files. You
      can run the example by typing

      cd ./example; ../src/radar -P finc.ma -Q finc.fasta1 -R finc.seq  -S finc.fasta2; cd ..
      
      after compiling.

      If you do not have a multiple alignment, you can also run radar
      in single sequence mode. Simply provide the sequence itself as the multiple
      alignment and set the corresponding parameter -A to 1:

      cd ./example; ../src/radar -P finc.seq -Q finc.fasta1 -R finc.seq  -S finc.fasta2; cd ..
